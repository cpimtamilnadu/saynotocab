      <h6><strong>APPEAL TO REGISTER YOUR PROTEST AGAINST THE CITIZENSHIP(AMENDMENT) ACT</strong></h6>
      <h6>
        <p>Dear fellow citizens of India,</br>
          &emsp;&emsp;The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill (CAB) has been passed in both the Houses of our
          Parliament and post the assent of President of India, and the notification in the official
          Gazette on 12.12.2019, the bill has now become an act.</br>
          &emsp;&emsp;We bring to your kind notice, some of the detrimental aspects of the Citizenship
          Amendment act, request to register your protest against this act to the BJP government at
          the centre and urge it to repeal the Act.</p>
      </h6>
    </div>
    <div id="WhyOppose" class="row no-border no-padding-top">
      <div>
        <h5>Why this act has to be opposed?</h5>
        <p>
          <h6><strong>1. According to the ‘Statement of Objects and Reasons’ of this act, members of
              Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian religious communities who
              have faced religious persecution in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh and
              have come to India till December 31, 2014 will not be treated as illegal
              migrants and will be granted Indian citizenship. According to the act the
              refugees belonging to the above mentioned six religious communities from
              these countries will be given Indian citizenship if they have resided in India for
              five years or more. The earlier provision granted citizenship after a residence
              of 11 years or more to the migrants, and did not provide citizenship, based on
              religion. One could make out clearly and without any difficultly that this act
              omits Muslims of these countries from its ambit - which means that Muslims
              from these Muslim countries will be considered as illegal migrants and not be
              provided citizenship.</strong></h6>
        </p>
        <p>
          <h6><strong>2. The reason stated in the ‘Statement of Objects and Reasons’ of the Bill is that, these three
              countries constitutionally provide for a “state religion”; thus, the Bill is to protect “religious
              minorities” in these theocratic states.</strong></h6>
        </p>
        <p>The act assumes that in a theocratic state only people from minority religious communities will be persecuted
          and co-religionists will not be attacked and tortured. Shias in Pakistan, a different sect of Islam religion,
          face severe persecution in Pakistan. Ahmadiyya Muslims, an Islamic revivalist sect face brutal persecution in
          Pakistan. They will not be considered for Indian citizenship as per this new amendment act.</p>

        <p>Who is Malala of Pakistan? Has she not fought against Islamic fundamentalism in her Muslim majority state -
          Pakistan and has faced more cruel religious persecution? Is it not cruel and against the human rights
          standards to deny people like her, Indian citizenship, if they apply for it?</p>

        <p>This act deliberately misses out the most rational and scientific sect of humanity - namely the atheists from
          its ambit. People born in any religious communities, may become atheists at some point in their lives and wage
          a hard line fight against religious fundamentalism. They might be subject to both religious persecution and
          political persecution. Taslima Nasreen is a classic example of this case. She was subjected to more cruelty in
          Bangladesh than a Bangladeshi Hindu. As per our citizenship amendment act, we will not be able to consider
          giving citizenship to people like her anymore.</p>

        <p>
          <h6><strong>3. The Act conveniently avoids speaking about providing citizenship to refugees from other
              neighbouring countries of India – Srilanka, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar.</strong></h6>
        </p>
        <p>This Act deliberately omits the Buddhist majority state of Srilanka, which has history of persecuting Tamils
          for over 70 years. While the Tamil refugees from Srilanka are granted citizenship by almost all countries of
          the world, India is the only country that denies them citizenship. As a result, those Tamil refugees who came
          to the refugee camps of South India in their teen ages, though have grown old and become grandparents, yet
          they are stateless, and their children though are college educated, cannot seek employment in high paying
          organised sectors and can only take up day wage labour for their living. They can’t even buy motorcycles as it
          requires papers. </p>

        <p>Myanmar – a state that conducted genocide against Rohingya Muslims, many of whom have been forced to take
          refuge in India, is not included in the act.</p>

        <p>Bhutan is also constitutionally a religious state. Its official religion is Vajrayana Buddhism. Christian
          minorities in Bhutan are not even allowed to build churches and can only pray privately inside their homes. As
          a result, many Bhutanese Christians in the border areas travel to India to pray in our churches. Those
          Christian minorities of Bhutan are not beneficiaries under the Citizenship amendment act.</p>

        <p>The act provides citizenship to sufferers of only one kind of persecution, i.e. religious persecution. Other
          serious kinds of persecution are not considered. Political persecution which is one of the major reasons for
          people to leave their homeland is grossly omitted by the act.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h6><strong>4. How a country defines, who can become its citizens defines what that country is. India has
              proclaimed itself to be a secular republic country.</strong></h6>
          <p>The Hindu Sangh pariwars had always wanted to eliminate Muslims from the Indian territory. We all know that
            Savarkar, who is an accused co-conspirator in the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, and a diehard proponent
            of Hindu Rashtra, is the venerated hero of the Sangh pariwars – the RSS and its open party-political version
            BJP. He had forwarded the two-nation theory – a ‘Hindu India’ and a ‘Muslim Pakistan’ based on religion, in
            December 1939 in his presidential address to the Hindu Mahasabha. In the following year, i.e in 1940,
            Mohammed Ali Jinnah, in his presidential address to the Muslim League, demanded that Muslims of the Indian
            subcontinent should have their own state (Pakistan). Savarkar could naturally align with Jinnah as he
            thought that the separate state for Muslims proposed by Jinnah could fit in Muslims residing in India paving
            way for a Hindu India devoid of Muslims. So, in 1943, Savarkar said he had no quarrel with Jinnah. One could
            infer clearly from the history, that since the beginning, for the Sangh pariwars, the idea of India was
            nothing but a Hindu Rashtra devoid of Muslims.</p>

          <p>But for the founders of India, the idea of India was a secular India – a country that would remain a
            secular state and be a homeland to all people, irrespective of their caste, creed or religious faith. Hence,
            our nation remained constitutionally and practically, a secular state that never distinguished people based
            on their religion.</p>

          <p>But, this citizenship amendment act links citizenship with the religious affiliation of an individual which
            is the very antithesis of secularism. It by denying citizenship to Muslims from the Muslim states of
            Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, undermine the core secular tenets of our constitution and shatter the
            very secular foundation of our country.</p>

          <p><strong>Supreme court has clearly declared in many cases from 1970s onwards that secularism is one of the
              basic features of the Constitution of India which means that it can never be amended in any
              manner.</strong></p>
          <p>So, the act is completely violate the Indian Constitution and its sole aim is to destroy the secular
            democratic foundations of the Indian Republic.</p>
        </p>
        <p>
          <h6><strong>5. This act hence aims to further sharpen the communal divide and social polarization in the
              country, which is dangerously detrimental to the unity and integrity of our country. This act which is
              discriminatory against Muslims, will trigger violent outrage in the states of Pakistan, Afghanistan and
              Bangladesh against non-Muslim minorities and subject them to danger. This act will trigger violent outrage
              in Muslim majority states against Indians who go there for employment, and they may be attacked. Within
              India, this act will cause communal tensions and force the Indian Muslim citizens to seek refuge in other
              countries. </strong></h6>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          <h6><strong>6. Moreover, BJP will not stop with this Citizenship amendment act. National Register of Citizens
              (NRC) is soon to follow up the citizenship amendment act. The home minister has already spoken of this
              proposal in the parliament. We all know how NRC was executed in Assam. Some 1200 crores of people’s money
              have been spent for its execution in Assam alone. The family of Fakruddin Ali Ahmad, the fifth president
              of India, was unable to produce the documents mandated by the NRC project. As a result, they are at the
              verge of losing their citizenship. If the family of Indian president could suffer, imagine the danger to
              engulf an ordinary Indian citizen. Many Hindu landless single women in Assam could not provide the
              documents asked by the government to retain their citizenship. Those who have not submitted the documents
              mandated by the NRC project in Assam are soon to be sent to detention camps. If NRC is to be extended to
              the whole of India, lakhs of crores of public money meant for welfare schemes like education and health,
              would be diverted to this Nazi project. Citizenship amendment Act and NRC has already instilled fear in
              the minds of our Muslim brothers and sisters, that they are no longer citizens of India and might be
              kicked out of their country or might be sent to detention camps. People, whether they are Hindus or
              Muslims or Christians have lived in this Indian subcontinent, since time immemorial, much before the
              modern states of India, Pakistan or Bangladesh have come into existence. Do they not deserve a peaceful
              life? Is it fair to deny citizenship to them?</strong></h6>
        </p>
        <p>
          <h6>The passage of this Bill, along with the proclamations by this Modi-Shah BJP government to extend the
            National Register of Citizens (NRC) to the entire country, is the twin combination to change the character
            of the Indian Republic – from a secular democratic one into an “Hindutva Rashtra”, the RSS political
            project.</h6>
        </p>
        <p>It is the duty of secular citizens of India like us to stop the implementation BJP’s Hindu Nazi projects of
          Citizenship amendment act and the forthcoming National register of Citizens.</p>

Respected Sir,
  As a concerned citizen of India, I bring to your kind notice, some unconstitutional and detrimental aspects of the Citizenship Amendment Act. I request you to scrap the act in the best interest of our country and its citizens.  
    ⦁ The Honourable Supreme court of India, has clearly declared in many cases from 1970s, that secularism is one of the ‘basic features’ of the Constitution of India, which means that it can never be amended in any manner. The Citizenship Act provides Indian citizenship to people from Pakistan, Afghanistan and  Bangladesh based on Religion. The Act while providing citizenship to people from Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian religious communities coming into India from these three countries, omits Muslims from its ambit. They will still be treated as illegal migrants. This Citizenship Amendment Act links citizenship with the religious affiliation of an individual which is the very antithesis of secularism – the basic feature of our Indian constitution. Hence, this act is clearly unconstitutional.  
    ⦁ The reason stated in the ‘Statement of Objects and Reasons’ of the Bill as introduced in the parliament is that, these three countries constitutionally provide for a “state religion”; thus, the Bill is to protect “religious minorities” in these theocratic states. The Act assumes that in those states only people from minority religious communities will be persecuted and co-religionists will not be attacked and tortured. In Pakistan, people belonging to the Islamic sects of Shias and Ahmadiyya face religious persecution. Denial of citizenship to such sufferers is very inhuman, discriminatory and is against the core doctrines of all International Human Rights Standards and of our secular constitution.  
    ⦁ This Citizenship Amendment Act that sets religion as a criteria for providing citizenship deliberately misses out the most rational and scientific sect of humanity - namely the atheists from its ambit.
    ⦁ This bill deliberately omits the Buddhist majority state of Srilanka, which has a history of persecuting Tamils for over 70 years. While the Tamil refugees from Srilanka are granted citizenship by almost all countries of the world, India is the only country that denies them citizenship. As a result, Srilankan refugees lead a pathetic life in the south Indian refugee camps for over 40 years.
    ⦁ Myanmar,  a state that conducted genocide against Rohingya Muslims, many of who have been forced to take refuge in India, is not included in the act.
    ⦁ Bhutan which is constitutionally a religious state, whose official religion is Vajrayana Buddhism, discriminates its Christian minorities and does not even allow them to build churches to pray. Those Christian minorities of Bhutan are not beneficiaries under the Citizenship amendment act.
    ⦁ All these omissions reveal that the real intention of the BJP led government is not upholding human rights but is 
      i) to instill a psychological fear in the minds of Muslims in India that they might be stripped of their citizenship  
      ii) to create communal tensions between religious communities in the country, and to permanently divide Indian citizens into two sections- "Hindus, non-Hindus" 
      iii) to realize the agenda of RSS - the parent organization of BJP to convert India into a “Hindu Rashtra” – a country devoid of Muslims.
    ⦁ The proposed expansion of National Register of Citizenship project has already instilled fear in the minds of Muslims in India they might be stripped of their Indian citizenship and be sent to detention camps like in Assam. This Citizenship amendment act is a precursor to the All India NRC project to be implemented with an aim to oppress Muslims by stripping off their citizenship and chase them out of our country.  
  As this unconstitutional act aims to further sharpen the communal divide, shatter the secular foundation of our country and is detrimental to the unity and integrity of India, we request you to scrap the Citizenship Amendment Act of 2019 and uphold the Constitution of India and its basic features.
