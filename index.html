      <h5>Dear...</br>
        I bring to your kind notice, some of the unconstitutional and detrimental aspects of the Citizenship Amendment
        act. I request you to scrap the act in the best interest of this country its citizens.</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="row no-border no-padding-top">
      <div>
        <p>
          <h6><strong>1. According to this citizenship amendment act, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and
              Christian religious communities who have faced religious persecution in Pakistan, Afghanistan and
              Bangladesh and have come to India till December 31, 2014 will not be treated as illegal migrants and will
              be granted Indian citizenship. The act deliberately omits the Muslims of these countries from its ambit -
              considers them as illegal migrants and denies Indian citizenship to them.</strong></h6>
        </p>
        <p>
          <h6><strong>2. The reason stated in the ‘Statement of Objects and Reasons’ of the Bill as introduced in the
              parliament is that, these three countries constitutionally provide for a “state religion”; thus, the Bill
              is to protect “religious minorities” in these theocratic states.</strong></h6>
        </p>
        <p>
          The act assumes that in those states only people from minority religious communities will be persecuted and
          co-religionists will not be attacked and tortured. We all know that in Pakistan, Shias, an Islamic sect,
          Ahmadiyya Muslims, an Islamic revivalist sect face religious persecution. There are also Muslims like the
          young Nobel peace laureate, Malala Yousufzai of Pakistan, who wage ardent fight against Islamic fundamentalism
          and get brutally attacked by fundamentalists. The act does not consider the plight of such sufferers on the
          ground that they are Muslims. This is very discriminatory and is against the core doctrines of all
          International Human Rights Standards and our secular constitution.
        </p>

        <p>
          <h6><strong>3. This act deliberately misses out the most rational and scientific sect of humanity - namely the
              atheists from its ambit. People born in any religious communities, may become atheists at some point in
              their lives and wage a hardline fight against religious fundamentalism. They might be subject to both
              religious persecution and political persecution. Taslima Nasreen, an atheist for her critical literary
              works against Islam was subjected to more cruelty in Bangladesh than any Bangladeshi Hindu. This
              citizenship amendment act denies Indian citizenship to people like her.</strong></h6>
        </p>
        <p>
          <h6><strong>4. The act conveniently avoids speaking about providing citizenship to refugees from other
              neighbouring countries of India – Srilanka, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar.</strong></h6>
        </p>
        <p>
          This bill deliberately omits the Buddhist majority state of Srilanka, which has history of persecuting Hindu
          Tamils for over 70 years. While the Tamil refugees from Srilanka are granted citizenship by almost all
          countries of the world, India is the only country that denies them citizenship. Srilankan refugees lead a
          pathetic life in the south Indian refugee camps for over 40 years.
          </br></br>
          Myanmar – a state that conducted genocide against Rohingya Muslims, many of who have been forced to take
          refuge in India, is not included in the act.
          </br></br>
          Bhutan – constitutionally a religious state whose official religion is Vajrayana Buddhism, discriminates its
          Christian minorities and does not even allow them to build churches to pray. Bhutanese Christians can only
          pray privately inside their homes. Those Christian minorities of Bhutan are not beneficiaries under the
          Citizenship amendment act.
          </br></br>
          Moreover, the act provides citizenship to sufferers of only one kind of persecution, i.e. religious
          persecution. Other serious kinds of persecution are not considered. Political persecution which is one of the
          major reasons for people to leave their homeland is grossly omitted by the act.
          </br></br>
          All these omissions reveal the real intention of the BJP led government is not to uphold human rights but is
          </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i) to instil a psychological fear in the minds of Muslims in India that they
          might be stripped of their
          citizenship in future</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii) to create communal tensions between religious
          communities in the country, and to
          permanently divide Indian citizens into two sections- Hindus, non-Hindus</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii) to
          realise the agenda of RSS -
          the parent organisation of BJP to convert India into a “Hindu Rashtra” – a country devoid of Muslims.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h6><strong>5. This citizenship amendment act links citizenship with the religious affiliation of an
              individual which is the very antithesis of secularism – the basic principle of our Indian constitution.
              The act by denying citizenship to Muslims coming from the Muslim states of Pakistan, Afghanistan and
              Bangladesh, undermine the core secular tenets of our Indian constitution and attempt to shatter the very
              secular foundation of our country. The act hence is completely violative of the Indian Constitution, which
              does not allow the state to discriminate people based on religion and to provide or deny citizenship based
              on religion. The sole aim of the act is to destroy the secular democratic foundations of our Indian
              Republic.</strong></h6>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          <h6><strong>6. The act along with the proclamations by BJP government to extend the National Register of
              Citizens (NRC) to the entire country is the twin combination to change the character of the Indian
              Republic – from a secular democratic one into an “Hindutva Rashtra” - the RSS political project. The
              proposed expansion of National Register of Citizenship project has already instilled fear in the minds of
              Muslims in India that they will no longer be considered as citizens of India and might be kicked out of
              the country or might be sent to detention camps if they fail to produce documents mandated by the NRC to
              retain their citizenship. Citizenship amendment act is a precursor, to the NRC project to be implemented
              with an aim to oppress Muslims by stripping of their citizenship.</strong></h6>
        </p>
        <p>
          <h6>As this unconstitutional act aims to further sharpen the communal divide and social polarization in the
            country, which is dangerously detrimental to the unity and integrity of India, we request you to scrap the
            citizenship amendment act of 2019 and uphold the constitution of India.</h6>
